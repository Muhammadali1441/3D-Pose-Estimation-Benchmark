![Download](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download-v1.0-brightgreen)

## üìö Overview  
The **3D-Pose-Estimation-Benchmark** project allows you to study different pose estimation algorithms side-by-side. This application focuses on how methods like ArUco, PCA, and SolvePnP calculate 3D position and orientation from 2D data. Whether you're curious about these algorithms or want to enhance your computer vision skills, this project serves as an excellent resource.

## üíª Features  
- Compare multiple pose estimation algorithms.
- Visualize 3D positions from 2D data.
- Simple, user-friendly interface.
- Designed for learning and exploration.
- Implementations in Python using OpenCV.
  
## üì¶ System Requirements  
To successfully run the application, your computer should meet the following specifications:  
- **Operating System:** Windows, macOS, or Linux.
- **RAM:** At least 4 GB.
- **Processor:** Intel or AMD, 1.6 GHz or faster.
- **Python:** Version 3.6 or higher should be installed.
- **Libraries:** You need OpenCV and NumPy. These will be set up in the installation step.

## üöÄ Getting Started  
### **Step 1: Install Python**  
If you don‚Äôt have Python installed, download it from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Follow the setup instructions based on your operating system.

### **Step 2: Visit the Download Page**  
To get the latest version of the application, visit this page to download:  
[Download the latest version](https://github.com/Muhammadali1441/3D-Pose-Estimation-Benchmark/releases)  

### **Step 3: Download the Application**  
On the Releases page, you will see different versions of the application. Click on the link for the latest release. This will download a compressed file (ZIP or TAR). 

### **Step 4: Extract the Files**  
Once the download is complete, locate the compressed file on your computer. Right-click on the file and select ‚ÄúExtract Here‚Äù or use your preferred extraction tool. A new folder will be created with all the necessary files.

### **Step 5: Install Required Libraries**  
Open your terminal or command prompt. Navigate to the folder where you extracted the files. You can do this by typing:  
```
cd path_to_your_folder
```
Next, run the following command to install the required libraries:  
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This command will automatically install OpenCV and NumPy along with any other libraries listed in the requirements file.

### **Step 6: Run the Application**  
After successfully installing the libraries, you can run the application. In your terminal, type:  
```
python main.py
```
This command will start the application, and you will see the user interface appear.

## üéì How to Use  
Once the application is running, follow these steps to begin comparing algorithms:  
1. Choose the input images: Click the "Load Images" button to select the 2D images you want to work with.
2. Select the algorithms you want to compare: The application will have checkboxes for ArUco, PCA, and SolvePnP. Pick one or more.
3. Click the "Run" button: The algorithms will process the images and display the 3D outputs.
4. Explore the results: You can switch between the outputs of different algorithms easily.

## üö® Troubleshooting  
- **Error Messages:** If you face any errors while running the application, check that all libraries are properly installed. Re-run the library installation command if necessary.
- **Display Issues:** Ensure your graphics drivers are updated if you encounter visual problems.
